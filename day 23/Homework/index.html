    <p>Georgia[c] is a country in the Caucasus region on the coast of the Black Sea. It is located at the intersection of Eastern Europe and West Asia,[17][18] and is today generally regarded as part of Europe.[19] It is bordered to the north and northeast by Russia; to the west by the Black Sea, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to the southeast by Azerbaijan. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[20] It has a population of 3.9 million,[d][10] of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi.
