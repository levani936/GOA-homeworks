    <h1>Mercedes benz CLS 63 AMG</h1>
    <p>The Mercedes-Benz CLS (initially called the CLS-Class) is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz from December 2003 to August 2023.<br>
The original model was a four-door sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coup√©.<br>
[1] An estate (shooting brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS.[2] All models are available as a high performance
 AMG variant, although it wasn't until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all<br>
-wheel drive was offered.[3]</p>
