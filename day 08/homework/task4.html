     <P><i>Georgia</i> has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, gold mining, and textiles.<br>
     The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as <i>Colchis</i> and <i>Iberia</i>, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century, Georgians officially adopted <b>Christianity</b>, which contributed to their unification under the <u>Kingdom Of Georgia</u>.<br>
     <i>Georgia</i> reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of <b>King David VI</b> and <b>Queen Tamar</b>. Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated due to internal discord and pressure from various regional powers, including the <i>Mongols</i>, the <i>Ottoman Empire</i>, and <i>Persia</i>,
     before being gradually annexed into the <i>Russian Emripe</i> starting in 1801.</P>
